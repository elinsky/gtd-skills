# And If There Is an Action . . . What Is It?

**Doing a straightforward, clear-cut task that has a beginning and an end balances out the complexity-without-end that often vexes the rest of my life. Sacred simplicity.**
—Robert Fulghum

This is perhaps the most fundamental practice of this methodology. If there's something that needs to be done about the item in "in," then you need to decide what, exactly, that next action is. "Next action," again, means the next physical, visible activity that would be required to move the situation toward closure.

This is both easier and more difficult than it sounds.

The next action should be easy to figure out, but there are often some quick analyses and several planning steps that haven't occurred yet in your mind, and these have to happen before you can determine precisely what has to happen to complete the item, even if it's a fairly simple one.

Let's look at a sample list of the things that a person might typically have his or her attention on.

- Clean the garage
- Do my taxes
- Conference I'm going to
- Bobby's birthday
- Press release
- Performance reviews
- Management changes

Although each of these items may seem relatively clear as a task or project, determining the next action on each one will take some thought.

**Clean the garage** . . . Well, I just have to get in there and start. No, wait a minute, there's a big refrigerator in there that I need to get rid of first. I should find out if John Patrick wants it for his camp. I should . . .

*Call John re: refrigerator in garage.*

What about . . .

**Do my taxes**. . . but I actually can't start on them until I have my last investment income documents back. Can't do anything until then. So I'm . . .

*Waiting for documents from Acme Trust*

And for the . . .

**Conference I'm going to** . . . I need to find out whether Sandra is going to prepare a press kit for us. I guess I need to . . .

*E-mail Sandra re: press kits for the conference.*

. . . and so forth. The action steps—"Call John," "Waiting for documents," "E-mail Sandra"—are what need to be decided about everything that is actionable in your in-tray.

## The Action Step Needs to Be the Absolute Next Physical Thing to Do

**Until you know what the next physical action is, there's still more thinking required before anything can happen—before you're appropriately engaged.**

Remember that these are physical, visible activities. Many people think they've determined the next action when they get it down to "set meeting." But that's not the next action, because it's not descriptive of physical behavior. How do you set a meeting? Well, it could be with a phone call or an e-mail, but to whom? Decide. If you don't decide now, you'll still have to decide at some other point, and what this process is designed to do is actually get you to finish the thinking exercise about this item. If you haven't identified the next physical action required to kick-start it, there will be a psychological gap every time you think about it even vaguely. You'll tend to resist noticing it, which leads to procrastination.

When you get to a phone or to your computer, you want to have all your thinking completed so you can use the tools you have and the location you're in to more easily get things done, having already defined what there is to do.

### Determine what physical activity needs to happen to get you to decide.

What if you say to yourself, "Well, the next thing I need to do is decide what to do about this"? That's a tricky one. Deciding isn't really an action, because actions take time, and deciding doesn't. There's always some physical activity that can be done to facilitate your decision making. Ninety-nine percent of the time you just need more information before you can make a decision. That additional information can come from external sources ("Call Susan to get her input on the proposal") or from internal thinking ("Draft ideas about new reorganization"). Either way, there's still a next action to be determined in order to move the project forward.
